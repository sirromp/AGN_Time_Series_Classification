# AGN Time Series Classification

The work in this repository builds on that of [[1]](#1). This work can be accessed [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04135). The problem definition will be summarised and objectives outlined. 

# Definition of the Problem

The analysis of astrophysical time-series, here defined as some variable quantity such as flux or brightness can reveal much about their underlying physical nature. Fig. 1 shows such an example for the blazar PKS 2155-304

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis (provided you include the smartEllipses option in your preamble).
Unicode is supported.

============

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line. 

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

* this one
* that one
* the other one
